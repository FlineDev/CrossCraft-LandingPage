# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)


## Given the new Twitter API pricing, can I really post to Mastodon & Twitter for Free?

Yes, absolutely!

But unfortunately the steep Twitter API pricing (starting from $5,000 US/month for successful apps) doesn't allow us to provide cross-posting for Free using the "Send now" button. It is only available in the Pro tier, which is priced just slightly above what we have to pay to Twitter – this is the fairest price possible.

But we have also a built-in workaround to use cross-posting for Free: Just connect your Mastodon account only and send your message using the "Send now" button. After sending has completed, Twoot it! will conveniently show a "Share" button. Press it and select the Twitter app (which you need to install separately) – and you will be able to post the same message to Twitter with just a few more taps!

This is all we could do to provide a better experience for our Free users.


## I can't login to Twitter within the app – when I try, I am stuck at the Twitter homepage – what to do?

It appears there's a [bug on Twitter's end](https://twittercommunity.com/t/twitter-oauth-v2-bug-when-user-use-sign-in-with-google-to-sign-in-to-twitter/169651/5) preventing any apps from using Twitter authentication for users who make use of the "Sign in with Google" button. If this doesn't apply to you and you still face a login issue, please make sure to [drop an email](mailto:twoot.it@fline.dev) so we can investigate.

But for all affected users, there's a simple workaround:
1. Sign in to your Twitter account in your browser (if you haven't already)
2. Navigate to the "Change your password" screen (or click [here](https://twitter.com/settings/password))
3. Press the "Forgot password?" button
4. Follow the process which will verify you (e.g. with a verification code sent to your email address)
5. Once verified, you will be asked to "Enter your new password"

That's it, with a password set, you can now sign in to your account in Twoot it! with your Tweet handle & new password.
